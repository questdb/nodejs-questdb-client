### Certs used in tests generated by running:
> ./scripts/generateCerts.sh . questdbPwd123

### TODO:
- The client should grow the buffer and call flush() immediately instead of throwing on insufficient buffer size,
like other clients do.
Alternatively, the sender could be growing the buffer on row writes and shrinking it on a subsequent flush() call.
The bufferSize parameter in the constructor can also be optional if this is done.
- Config object for Sender
- Github actions to run 'npm test' on each commit and run 'npm publish' when version is bumped in package.json
- ~~Provide a builder style API:
  builder.table('tab').symbol('symName', any).intColumn('intCol', 34).timestampColumn('tsCol', 23232323).atNow();~~
- ~~The project lacks a linter. Use ESLint (https://eslint.org) or standard (https://standardjs.com)~~
- ~~Move certs/ under test/ since these are test specific files. Possibly generate certs from test.~~
- Test the client against a real QuestDB instance, not only mock. The easiest way to do it is to use https://www.npmjs.com/package/testcontainers
- ~~authenticate() function doesn't await for sender.socket.write() to happen and doesn't check for errors~~
- ~~Avoid resource leaks on await sender.connect(); await sender.connect();.
  As a bonus, we could even protect from concurrent connect calls, e.g. await Promise.all(sender.connect(), sender.connect());~~
- ~~The client should throw Error instances instead of strings.~~
- ~~sender.close() doesn't flush pending data to the socket. We should document this.~~
- Would be nice to accept alternative logger implementations to be used instead of console
- ~~Add 'use strict'; since we are using JS + CommonJS~~
- ~~"Typescript" should be "TypeScript" in the readme~~
- ~~Remove commented code from test/testapp.js~~
- Update node.js examples in QuestDB documentation
- Remove notes.md file
