 * The QuestDB client's API provides methods to connect to the database, ingest data and close the connection.
 * <p>
 * The client supports authentication. <br>
 * A JsonWebKey can be passed to the Sender in its constructor, the JsonWebKey will be used for authentication. <br>
 * If no JsonWebKey specified the client will not attempt to authenticate itself with the server. <br>
 * Details on how to configure QuestDB authentication: {@link https://questdb.io/docs/reference/api/ilp/authenticate}
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The client also supports TLS encryption to provide a secure connection. <br>
 * However, QuestDB does not support TLS yet and requires an external reverse-proxy, such as Nginx to enable encryption.

     *   Setting the flag to <i>false</i> results in reusing the same buffer instance for each flush() call. Use this flag only if calls to the client are serialised. <br>
